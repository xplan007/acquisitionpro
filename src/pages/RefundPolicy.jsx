        <section>
          <h2>1. Overview</h2>
          <p>
            At AcquisitionPro LLC, we are committed to delivering high-quality lead generation and
            client acquisition services for executive and leadership coaches. We understand that
            circumstances may change, and this policy outlines our refund and cancellation procedures.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>2. Service Nature</h2>
          <p>
            Our services are custom B2B marketing and lead generation engagements that require
            significant upfront work, including strategy development, funnel creation, ad campaign
            setup, and outreach system configuration. Because of the labor-intensive and custom
            nature of our services, the following refund terms apply.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Cancellation Policy</h2>
          <h3>Before Service Commencement</h3>
          <p>
            If you wish to cancel before any work has begun (prior to your strategy session), you may
            request a full refund of any payments made. Cancellation requests must be submitted in
            writing to <a href="mailto:contact@acquisitionpro.net">contact@acquisitionpro.net</a>.
          </p>

          <h3>After Service Commencement</h3>
          <p>
            Once work has begun (after the strategy session or any deliverables have been started),
            cancellations are handled as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Within the first 7 days of service commencement:</strong> You may cancel and
              receive a prorated refund minus any work already completed and costs incurred (ad spend,
              third-party tools, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>After 7 days of service commencement:</strong> Cancellations will be effective
              at the end of the current billing period. No refund will be issued for the current
              billing period, but no further charges will be made.
            </li>
